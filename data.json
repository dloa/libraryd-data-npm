A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.  satoshin@gmx.com www.bitcoin.org","year":2008,"extra-info":{"Bitcoin Address":"1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa","DHT Hash":"QmRA3NWM82ZGynMbYzAgYTSXCVM14Wx1RZ8fKP42G6gjgj","artist":"Satoshi Nakamoto","filename":"bitcoin.pdf"}},"payment":{"amount":"0,0,0","currency":"USD","type":"tip"},"extras":""},"signature":"IMAgFowf8TFdaTLDb3MUwTermXEtuAv6NN/MvQt1nkNWzDSg0KfSSQfF1QnzS75OLzM08J2rTIZXFT2OH0QlaUU="},"txid":"e4bd09b22c00425045c9342a5110d8d5ba974647985c80e5812b3b5797f3ae5c","block":1194848,"publisher-name":"satoshi"},{"block":1194871,"oip-041":{"artifact":{"publisher":"FV5HULcz8ZjQHrMJHwCRqosyLTUKtWzb8x","timestamp":1432167195000,"type":"music","info":{"title":"Chick-A-Layin' (instrumental)","description":"An unreleased, instrumental only version of The Biddy Bums' Chick-A-Layin'","year":2010,"extraInfo":{"artist":"The Biddy Bums","company":"","composers":null,"copyright":"","usageProhibitions":"","usageRights":"","genre":"","tags":null},"ExtraInfoString":""},"storage":{"network":"IPFS","location":"QmbjP9Q7SGFLjzgfYYWKpaafyefn8C9Rm5hYEPnJJr3BVU","files":[]},"payment":{"fiat":"USD","scale":"100:1","sugTip":[2,50,100],"tokens":null,"addresses":[{"token":"BTC","address":"1JHAsHv6uCzZkGu6TZ1aayPV8v7FaygkRy"}]}},"editArtifact":{"patch":null,"timestamp":0,"txid":""},"deactivateArtifact":{"txid":"","timestamp":0},"transferArtifact":{"txid":"","to":"","from":"","timestamp":0},"signature":"H3qh3n+yNv4gazaknlpZGlYf7kldyHBPT+CrqN5gDguz5b8aensHMgMBXm83YqK0Oz25ktO8YaT7FqeAef3D3mQ="},"tags":"","timestamp":1432167195000,"title":"Chick-A-Layin' (instrumental)","txid":"be1eeb28af2027a643673521aa837e323544339fd55ba4d32af7ed1240345093","type":"music","year":2010,"publisher":"FV5HULcz8ZjQHrMJHwCRqosyLTUKtWzb8x"},{"block":1195331,"oip-041":{"artifact":{"publisher":"FV5HULcz8ZjQHrMJHwCRqosyLTUKtWzb8x","timestamp":1432194111000,"type":"music","info":{"title":"FLAC audio test","description":"Excerpt taken from Primer Solo de Concierto para Clarinete track 4 from Vibraciones del Alma by Maximiliano Martin and Scott Mitchell.","year":2009,"extraInfo":{"artist":"Maximiliano Martin and Scott Mitchell","company":"","composers":null,"copyright":"","usageProhibitions":"","usageRights":"","genre":"","tags":["24bit 192kHz Free Lossless Audio Codec"]},"ExtraInfoString":""},"storage":{"network":"IPFS","location":"QmY4KXsCA1DEix74emacdCDR8TQHd7wieFLR47RQMqWpec","files":[]},"payment":{"fiat":"USD","scale":"","sugTip":null,"tokens":null,"addresses":[{"token":"BTC","address":""}]}},"editArtifact":{"patch":null,"timestamp":0,"txid":""},"deactivateArtifact":{"txid":"","timestamp":0},"transferArtifact":{"txid":"","to":"","from":"","timestamp":0},"signature":"H4B55QrwtLoFvOKhx73DO8hHtR4UfX0s7yHmh+vjiMJZkRASQgZjmZZzjkaXOoO26GM3nrtMHwqttGERCWEj18I="},"tags":"24bit 192kHz Free Lossless Audio Codec","timestamp":1432194111000,"title":"FLAC audio test","txid":"298f619f15126099b8eab3eb58aaf803c99c48515c31c11f064b66d0bad0b17d","type":"music","year":2009,"publisher":"FV5HULcz8ZjQHrMJHwCRqosyLTUKtWzb8x"},{"block":1196166,"oip-041":{"artifact":{"publisher":"FV5HULcz8ZjQHrMJHwCRqosyLTUKtWzb8x","timestamp":1432240839000,"type":"music","info":{"title":"Ghosts I Track 2","description":"Nine Inch Nails presents Ghosts I - IV, a brand new 36 track instrumental collection available right now.

Berlin","description":"What is SquatConf? It started in Paris Nov 2014 ...  Squatconf happened in November 2014 in Paris in a squat, hence the name. It wasn't your typical IT conference because it was mostly Just-in-Time-organized by all the people who attend. There were no advertisements from Silicon Valley companies (or any others) and several people felt free to give somewhat radical talks on technologies and society, even openly associate with anarchism. There also were a fair share of advanced tech talks on web Crypto, decentralized tech demos, internet of things, automatic garden planting systems and what not. And we had many personal conversations among each other which continue to this day. ... and now we go to Berlin end april 2016!  We want to make another Squatconf happening happen around end April 2016 in Berlin.","year":2016,"extra-info":{"DHT Hash":"QmTdzkts5cvmkPxT7otfPTpdw6AtpCTL8AwBhdFcmkZSPp","artist":"SquatConf.eu","filename":"index.html","runtime":0}},"payment":null,"extras":""},"signature":"HySZgkNFpR+yYk0Eqcd/wn/4scJmgQR+DR/Jdggxa3H5U21WTJoSAcrjLCPGLz38/ZSK1SLtK2GK80OOP+lWVZw="},"txid":"28bbbce5c1636cd46525be3b9b350e17f71726959cdfdcfe609c439e54d16650","block":1699601,"publisher-name":"Copernicus Mogley"},{"block":1727243,"oip-041":{"artifact":{"publisher":"FRuxNCDNFj9qqjRQdqemyfkMdQpCJK3DNn","timestamp":1461796396,"type":"music","info":{"title":"Lady J","description":"Lady J","year":2003,"extraInfo":{"artist":"","company":"","composers":null,"copyright":"","usageProhibitions":"","usageRights":"","genre":"","tags":null},"ExtraInfoString":""},"storage":{"network":"IPFS","location":"Qmeke1CyonqgKErvGhE18WLBuhrLaScbpSAS6vGLuoSCXM","files":[]},"payment":{"fiat":"USD","scale":"100:1","sugTip":null,"tokens":null,"addresses":[{"token":"BTC","address":""}]}},"editArtifact":{"patch":null,"timestamp":0,"txid":""},"deactivateArtifact":{"txid":"","timestamp":0},"transferArtifact":{"txid":"","to":"","from":"","timestamp":0},"signature":"IIMwSXR2faC+zqKkDSuRzhKYjN5hOq3uP5hvqSzxpJPfBoEl8Q5FFw4FRvOJrke3sNCCrV7oFxZM5oQRhmFbJ4I="},"tags":"","timestamp":1461796396,"title":"Lady J","txid":"7c30b14f2aed16d745234700cb8df779453d4595baed78485c6426209202f100","type":"music","year":2003,"publisher":"FRuxNCDNFj9qqjRQdqemyfkMdQpCJK3DNn"},{"block":1727259,"oip-041":{"artifact":{"publisher":"FRuxNCDNFj9qqjRQdqemyfkMdQpCJK3DNn","timestamp":1461797320,"type":"music","info":{"title":"Lady J","description":"Lady J with a really long description so it goes into multiple parts and really tests stuff.","year":2003,"extraInfo":{"artist":"","company":"","composers":null,"copyright":"","usageProhibitions":"","usageRights":"","genre":"","tags":null},"ExtraInfoString":""},"storage":{"network":"IPFS","location":"Qmeke1CyonqgKErvGhE18WLBuhrLaScbpSAS6vGLuoSCXM","files":[]},"payment":{"fiat":"USD","scale":"100:1","sugTip":null,"tokens":null,"addresses":[{"token":"BTC","address":""}]}},"editArtifact":{"patch":null,"timestamp":0,"txid":""},"deactivateArtifact":{"txid":"","timestamp":0},"transferArtifact":{"txid":"","to":"","from":"","timestamp":0},"signature":"H3HbHi56xm5SBrLNdSgh1GVQ/PNE8RSUtzpnI3MbCct1SfAP0X5LuOu0iOweTQnW4oETapyzapS0lTc+klwQNfo="},"tags":"","timestamp":1461797320,"title":"Lady J","txid":"eefa0c04ed0a93fe654fa1883f32d5b52354d4d7a72f5900d04bfec782f28838","type":"music","year":2003,"publisher":"FRuxNCDNFj9qqjRQdqemyfkMdQpCJK3DNn"},{"media-data":{"alexandria-media":{"torrent":"QmTZrDEypd6xTzf2etNC91YTqFxdLfyfSP1muvTifLGAS7","publisher":"FNJSwzfMPSzRLFR9pDXQ7heL6timk79nZ3","timestamp":1461817276,"type":"video","info":{"title":"Heroin - Not Even Once","description":"Heroin use is a bad thing.

To describe a common hacker is to describe a hobbyist - hanging out at the local hackerspace and playing with personal projects after necessary paid labour. This covers their subsistence, but also probably more or less directly powers the bullshit neoliberal political reality, with its destructive effects on society and nature. Hackbases are a new type of institution to enable work in the other direction. They are hackerspaces you can also live in, for any period of time, with minimized need for dealing with (earning, spending) money. The goal is to design and spread a tech-forward model of infrastructure and a lifestyle, supporting free, full-time avantgarde technologists and people in general, serving the commons. This talk should equip and inspire you to visit one of the existing bases (like CHT in Lanzarote, Canary Islands @ http://totalism.org/), or even better, reorganize your living situation to start a new one.\n\nSpeaker : David Potocnik\nSquatConf Berlin 2016","year":2016,"extra-info":{"DHT Hash":"QmaQ32eidqeHFD5KQM8NNqRpWufNP6HXuNKVPFFfG7hLV8","artist":"Adjy Leak","filename":"SquatConf-Berlin-Hackbases-infrastructure-for-postcapitalism-AdjyLeak.mp4","files":[{"dname":"","fname":"SquatConf-Berlin-Hackbases-infrastructure-for-postcapitalism-AdjyLeak.mp4","runtime":"922","type":"video"}],"runtime":"922"}},"payment":{},"extras":""},"signature":"Hyn+2C+5cq9enigqyNzjM3MYv/mb4GecdT2KcatIBJLnRRhUJhgMBnFpOLMCMUroY6X97W4hwo1zl7G7cqSyynA="},"txid":"546801109c96a666501178108e0b0fa05f7c16eaaa4c75c73b7a6232175a8f63","block":1746050,"publisher-name":"SquatConf Video"},{"media-data":{"alexandria-media":{"torrent":"Qmd8UqKGaJiyZ9WH16eyoeRXAaycbrAmfQSRF1muBqhL3q","publisher":"FLHP1SVdUSWWWnU43qBotWmHUBXYbwS4Ds","timestamp":1463095576,"type":"video","info":{"title":"Home On The Range","description":"On the activities of Western ranchers.

Contemporary decentralization and encryption technologies offer potential solutions to many of the broken aspects of the internet that presently plague privacy concerned users.\n\nThe current internet client-server model was constructed in an inherently counter-privacy, easily monitored and centralized way, giving rise to a movement of anti-surveillance projects that could give users a chance to reclaim and retain their personal data.\n\nMight there be some value in transparency of online user data versus total or granular privacy? Do we, as users, know and understand the threats of using internet communication services to share our experiences online?\n\nFinally, the panel shares tools that are currently available and anticipated to be released soon which can help build a new private and safe network for all users.\n\nLiberty Forum 2016 - Free State Project - New Hampshire","year":2016,"extra-info":{"DHT Hash":"QmQ4GjYxLfBaUKyYuCC3MCmuNUmG1SPHvKFeWHc589ec9n","artist":"Adjy Leak","filename":"The-Future-of-Internet-Privacy-Liberty-Forum-2016-AdjyLeak-360p.mp4","files":[{"dname":"","fname":"The-Future-of-Internet-Privacy-Liberty-Forum-2016-AdjyLeak-360p.mp4","runtime":"2746","type":"video"}],"runtime":"2746"}},"payment":{},"extras":""},"signature":"H19tUX1QoHUQfQaMlMtF34UbrUm9DmSs7Tr+l4mbO2amZkUwL/gwv7QWODfawyEBGS5E2e8jeJLoRC3wpWPnFhg="},"txid":"8a11f1f25531fdc582a5e2936ab08712b9a848f327124073a87cdaae1a6371f3","block":1756063,"publisher-name":"AdjyLeak.video"},{"media-data":{"alexandria-media":{"torrent":"QmUNsggN1dTWxnG5JKXkRNKHQfRBn8cxiHDcPAcbaSqR3U","publisher":"FTGvjB7QtsdFioXwuqJBecuqfKhBJcJNG7","timestamp":1463810254,"type":"video","info":{"title":"The Master-Key System to Riches","description":"Napoleon Hill (October 26, 1883 -- November 8, 1970) \n\n","year":1960,"extra-info":{"DHT Hash":"QmUNsggN1dTWxnG5JKXkRNKHQfRBn8cxiHDcPAcbaSqR3U","artist":"Napoleon Hill","company":"Napoleon Hill","filename":"Napoleon Hill - The Master Key System to Riches by Napoleon Hill.mp4","files":[{"dname":"","fname":"Napoleon Hill - The Master Key System to Riches by Napoleon Hill.mp4","runtime":"7561","type":"video"},{"dname":"","fname":"16488727_129936453588.jpg","type":"preview"}],"posterFrame":"16488727_129936453588.jpg","runtime":"7561"}},"payment":{},"extras":""},"signature":"ILndU42z0ysX5Gs8S9yeSp33/xedzd5mZsqoI3Su6ZYSYihcdjkxwXqawC/4W2mR8vUno5W6UCrE875ZC20c6D8="},"txid":"95b244093df3445931ffe447b67e62251a40104096b783249d98f1b3a82bf8dd","block":1758958,"publisher-name":"BayAreaCoins"},{"media-data":{"alexandria-media":{"torrent":"QmVvb1zriLP2ksscjDBr5Rks6JSTGZQRw79Lw9gLaa8Pbk","publisher":"FSgGnafeBj7bknStqJrUAg2EGy7AEfdwJ5","timestamp":1463854144,"type":"video","info":{"title":"Redecentralize | London","description":"Ideas and reactions of participants following Redecentralize unconference 2015 in London.","year":2016,"extra-info":{"DHT Hash":"QmVvb1zriLP2ksscjDBr5Rks6JSTGZQRw79Lw9gLaa8Pbk","artist":"Adjy Leak","filename":"Redecentralize-London-2015-AdjyLeak-360p.mp4","files":[{"dname":"","fname":"Redecentralize-London-2015-AdjyLeak-360p.mp4","runtime":"195","type":"video"}],"runtime":"195"}},"payment":{},"extras":""},"signature":"H08jHu4EZp8MpEmXQllHt0n9qv3ENS4Izmt6V4EkoSLaS21TGQ3zOGVeLH0ZA/mUw8R3m14kKZkWbtSijqS5pjU="},"txid":"61cdceef06ce119919161d0be36d96463e3a923eb5fd66f0d2e26269e452c178","block":1759523,"publisher-name":"AdjyLeak.video"},{"media-data":{"alexandria-media":{"torrent":"QmVvb1zriLP2ksscjDBr5Rks6JSTGZQRw79Lw9gLaa8Pbk","publisher":"FSgGnafeBj7bknStqJrUAg2EGy7AEfdwJ5","timestamp":1463857107,"type":"video","info":{"title":"Redecentralize | London","description":"Ideas and reactions from participants following Redecentralize unconference on 17-18 October 2015.","year":2016,"extra-info":{"DHT Hash":"QmVvb1zriLP2ksscjDBr5Rks6JSTGZQRw79Lw9gLaa8Pbk","artist":"Adjy Leak","filename":"Redecentralize-London-2015-AdjyLeak-360p.mp4","files":[{"dname":"","fname":"Redecentralize-London-2015-AdjyLeak-360p.mp4","runtime":"195","type":"video"}],"runtime":"195"}},"payment":{},"extras":""},"signature":"IDViIysO7wGsPhgpSAPl4UzCuZXMgGr+NSYJYgVpvCPXBRx0re6oMNBy9qGFnzrPLkf3DsSJ07dXXuG3Irlp0jI="},"txid":"ed046fe255803e68d7ae0d70138aa2d5698721a113402e1aa6dc2a703a36b1bb","block":1759560,"publisher-name":"AdjyLeak.video"},{"media-data":{"alexandria-media":{"torrent":"QmYmmKGSBAHy7Kax3R8YAb85u8PwdQktdKcfcTkfedmWwL","publisher":"FS7Pp9y6bxJdZyYUSdfNbpgKpZT4fDYswt","timestamp":1464715223,"type":"video","info":{"title":"Harambe the Gorilla pulls boy through the water - Cincinnati Zoo","description":"Boy Falls into Gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo.

A subsequent initiation into the secretive Suicide Club propelled Law into a thirty-eight year \"career\" amidst the hidden world of pranks, urban exploration, counter culture, 'Culture Jamming' and creative mayhem.\n\nFight Club, Burning Man, SantaCon, media hacking, urban exploration, street art, flash mobs and more - these are some of the cultural phenomena that were initiated or somehow influenced by the Suicide Club, and the subsequent sub-cultures that Law was fortunate to have fallen into as a teenaged juvenile delinquent. This presentation reveals some of the genesis \u0026 history of these groups including a brief survey of their precedents and influences on through the present day iterations, spin offs and 'fellow travellers'. The idea we hope you take away from this presentation is simply this: this strange, obscure world is available to anyone who can appreciate the concept that \"you may already be a member\".\n\nJohn Law (original member of the Suicide Club and the Cacophony Society.

This fungi synthesizes the psychoactive compounds Psilocybin and Psilocin and the biosynthetic pathways for this is currently unknown. These schedule 1 compounds are being studied for their use in patients with advanced stage terminal cancer anxiety. We believe a public anonymously authored genome sequence will aid in the identification of the biosynthetic pathways and thus afford more efficient synthesis in other more easily cultured fungi or yeast. While natural sources of these compounds exist, their potency varies by an order of magnitude and several cases of toxic poisoning have been reported in the clinical literature due to visual misidentification of fungi.\n\n The genome sequence is a draft whole genome shotgun of just under 50 megabases and is more contiguous than other controversial genomes like this. We suspect it will be heavily downloaded. To our knowledge this is the first authorless genome and we believe that is fitting with the message of this fungi. The sequence can be verified with BLAST. The ITS regions agree down to the species level and thousands of strong hits exist to Galerina marinata.","year":2016,"extra-info":{"DHT Hash":"QmQdc7enTXxSz1iZZfnwtY5Xv4iYLhjyoEkurAhy6tuyiG","artist":"Melted Ego","company":"locus coeruleus","filename":"PC_genome.png","files":[{"duration":18.99981,"fname":"PICT1494.AVI","type":"video"},{"dname":"Cover Art","fname":"PC_genome.png","type":"preview"},{"fname":"index.html","type":"Artwork"},{"fname":"PICT1491.JPG","type":"Artwork"},{"fname":"PICT1492.JPG","type":"Artwork"},{"fname":"PICT1493.JPG","type":"Artwork"},{"fname":"PICT1495.JPG","type":"Artwork"},{"fname":"PICT1486.JPG","type":"Artwork"},{"fname":"PICT1487.JPG","type":"Artwork"},{"fname":"PICT1488.JPG","type":"Artwork"},{"fname":"PICT1489.JPG","type":"Artwork"},{"fname":"PICT1490.JPG","type":"Artwork"}],"posterFrame":"PC_genome.png"}},"payment":{},"extras":""},"signature":"H7tFbjioL0fiNAeJ8RrGI5LoqDhQV6plM+exVc2+BNAnMTkxHl/uGGYnScjovd+QQ3XfO1aEGUIrs+70Wht6zuo="},"txid":"6acf55a021688f9da0979a145c7a41e6ef4feae3478a700c4565cf1c92dc59df","block":1885847,"publisher-name":"Melted Ego"},{"block":1886161,"oip-041":{"artifact":{"publisher":"FLj4mASG1WmNs6WHkxPqDK83asdub6qdt8","timestamp":1470974589,"type":"music","info":{"title":"Twenty-First Century March","description":"Twenty-First Century March is a full orchestra composition that includes 29 instruments.

This controversial rule raised many concerns, including with respect to its compatibility with open-source router OSes such as OpenWrt.\n\nThis environment prompted the prpl Foundation to sponsor a venturesome experiment: What would it take to put OpenWrt into a virtual machine on a typical Wifi-router platform, isolating it from the Wifi driver and configuration to comply with FCC's rules? The prpl Foundation set out to combine its OpenWrt expertise with its Security engineering subgroup. prpl member Kernkonzept was just about to release its new MIPS port of its L4Re microhypervisor as the first open-source hypervisor for MIPS' new VZ virtualization extensions. As MIPS has been the dominant architecture for Wifi router devices, this appeared to be a good fit.\n\nIn this talk, we'll take you along for the ride that ensued. We'll demonstrate OpenWrt running in a virtual machine on top of the L4Re microhypervisor, and show you that good, the bad, and the ugly. We will also highlight other use cases for router virtualization besides the FCC's.\n\nMichael Hohmuth, Kernkonzept\nOpenWrt Summit 2016\n13 October 2016 - Berlin","year":2016,"extra-info":{"Bitcoin Address":"1KZS9doxU3AGzKVngspQJvsJni7u3AmLCB","DHT Hash":"Qmbj5b2MmhLEQk8rTZuKG3cMoJQaWXa9CKJv9qWKJwWxh9","artist":"Adjy Leak","filename":"FCC-compliance-with-open-source-adjyleak.jpg","files":[{"dname":"FCC compliance with open source","duration":1255.317188,"fname":"FCC-compliance-with-open-source-adjyleak-480.mp4","type":"video"},{"dname":"FCC compliance with open source [HD]","duration":1255.270748,"fname":"FCC-compliance-with-open-source-adjyleak-720.mp4","type":"video"},{"dname":"Cover Art","fname":"FCC-compliance-with-open-source-adjyleak.jpg","type":"preview"}],"genre":"Technology/Science","posterFrame":"FCC-compliance-with-open-source-adjyleak.jpg","tags":"OpenWrt, open source, FCC"}},"payment":{},"extras":""},"signature":"IEhHfdpdQe3k1BWw/ZdPnYGs7KzAl154BK1fBwP3G70cDvJbhlJJ66uYkPDJOX4+ZPDsKIrSMX4d0GlNwn9GMSA="},"txid":"44c11a2ef29cbe33dea4c1c80fe6ac6b13cb018e531e0b39ef036166fa53255c","block":1953322,"publisher-name":"OpenWrt Summit 2016"},{"media-data":{"alexandria-media":{"torrent":"QmUDo7uuPgTUTEwveHwDNbZ98GHhqrXVDZ7qzMHLjAoCc4","publisher":"FTXtSXfkBQitmBftS4qFwiwFWNp3SugsSW","timestamp":1477338854,"type":"video","info":{"title":"The Serval Mesh Extender: Using OpenWrt to support disaster communications","description":"The Serval Project has for the past six years been working to create infrastructure-free mobile telecommunications systems, so that people can communicate anywhere, anytime.

While most OpenWrt users need just one single WAN interface for all broadband traffic, we are confronted with telcos requiring multiple services on the WAN. For example, they might want to separate data, video, voice and management traffic in multiple VLANs.\n\nThis year, we'd like to introduce a related challenge: how to support an OpenWrt based product that can be connected to the Internet via one of many different types of WAN interfaces like Ethernet, DSL and LTE-- each employing one of many different protocols like PPP and DHCP--in a manner which is transparent to the rest of the system?\n\nOpenWrt does not provide an out of the box solution for this use case today. In this presentation, we will describe the use cases in more detail and present our solution which includes new OpenWrt packages and scripts.\n\nJohan Peeters, Technicolor\nOpenWrt Summit 2016\n13 October 2016 - Berlin","year":2016,"extra-info":{"Bitcoin Address":"1KZS9doxU3AGzKVngspQJvsJni7u3AmLCB","DHT Hash":"QmdRXPEuRpS2gD1Vd6oYEGYyNjkkd1ftqsSXBV9YB79iWk","artist":"Adjy Leak","filename":"Supporting-multiple-WAN-interfaces-in-a-seamless-and-transparent-way-adjyleak.jpg","files":[{"dname":"Supporting multiple WAN interfaces","duration":1208.807619,"fname":"Supporting-multiple-WAN-interfaces-in-a-seamless-and-transparent-way-adjyleak-480.mp4","type":"video"},{"dname":"Supporting multiple WAN interfaces [HD]","duration":1208.761179,"fname":"Supporting-multiple-WAN-interfaces-in-a-seamless-and-transparent-way-adjyleak-720.mp4","type":"video"},{"dname":"Cover Art","fname":"Supporting-multiple-WAN-interfaces-in-a-seamless-and-transparent-way-adjyleak.jpg","type":"preview"}],"genre":"Technology/Science","posterFrame":"Supporting-multiple-WAN-interfaces-in-a-seamless-and-transparent-way-adjyleak.jpg","tags":"OpenWrt, open source, network interfaces"}},"payment":{},"extras":""},"signature":"H3gtFrXJqE5uPfoiRG5zECb3f7ui2aVw+Nh7jcVZa3M5d1pwDlsZUSWWtdewFsDAQeUKQ8W7vQI4pJVPm1FVz2A="},"txid":"922f38b414603085766daf6416ca99036a42065711b257a394370b52facefdeb","block":1953776,"publisher-name":"OpenWrt Summit 2016"},{"media-data":{"alexandria-media":{"torrent":"QmNkScj33Fy5cnzAEXrSeEGiqHUxUqoTHkKyL391D1XDe2","publisher":"FSgGnafeBj7bknStqJrUAg2EGy7AEfdwJ5","timestamp":1477414476,"type":"video","info":{"title":"Best-practice for NAND-based firmware using UBI","description":"An increasing amount of recent embedded boards come with NAND storage.

The film went unreleased when the director joined the Marine Corps, a story documented by the fan who created an original score for it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/4fwcdi/anyone_remember_prelude_to_hope/\nShortly after returning home from the Iraq War, director Devon Read felt compelled to revisit his abandoned fan-film, but this time wanted to focus more on the story of the soldiers on the ground who made the incredible but previously untold-of sacrifices to get Leia the plans for the Death Star and allow Luke to get off his one-in-a-million shot to destroy it. Again it went unreleased due to another deployment to the middle east, but after seeing Rogue One, Devon had this to say \"it's exactly the gritty and beautiful film that I wish i'd had the storytelling talent, resources to tell, the first star wars film that actually felt like an actual war film. It was inspiring and emotional and possibly my favorite in the franchise.\"","year":2001,"extra-info":{"DHT Hash":"QmXkEdZxTxGaSMccEa7i9aDTHZVZt2fcv3MqSjBomreaQW","artist":"Devon Read","filename":"prelude_a_sm.mov","files":[{"dname":"First Teaser Trailer (1999)","duration":45.111778,"fname":"prelude_a_sm.mov","type":"video"},{"dname":"Second Trailer (2000)","duration":100.658503,"fname":"pth_trailerB_small.mp4","type":"video"},{"dname":"Third Trailer (Early Sept, 2001)","duration":67.314649,"fname":"pth_trailerC_small.mp4","type":"video"},{"dname":"Unreleased Rough Cut with some Finished Visual Effects","duration":1293.693333,"fname":"prelude-to-hope-2001.m4v","type":"video"},{"dname":"Flashback Scene With Veronica Mars fan-favorite Brandon Hillock","duration":76.606616,"fname":"pth_deleted_scene_medium.mp4","type":"video"},{"dname":"Prelude 2 Hope Teaser (2006)","duration":72.284,"fname":"Prelude 2 Hope Teaser.mp4","type":"video"},{"dname":"Cover Art","fname":"p2h-screenshot.png","type":"preview"}],"genre":"Star Wars Fan Film","posterFrame":"p2h-screenshot.png"}},"payment":{},"extras":""},"signature":"IABUiloocN7/5aKzYRSwik17tFLI/Lpl02MmiYS2uORRZapPEPIaqvkz9seGsS9k1iNLDYXz7vhYTL5zNQMyn5U="},"txid":"655ca6e880170ed38900dc87bcc733edfa671d60783c292012938112618d4c23","block":2007148,"publisher-name":"devonjames"},{"media-data":{"alexandria-media":{"torrent":"QmWFed9n2b3betMiVRkkxMw52sE79Voo6zZbuKLwGuqXPV","publisher":"FGom8PJVMQGUr36NaXbHhugw57gFMCa3g8","timestamp":1482917304,"type":"video","info":{"title":"Everything is hate speech?","description":"Backup of a video from YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C14qBQNjD8A\n-----------------------------------\nPublished on Dec 21, 2016\nGet my new album here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/eve...\n\nOn iTunes \u0026 Google Play this Christmas","year":2016,"extra-info":{"DHT Hash":"QmWFed9n2b3betMiVRkkxMw52sE79Voo6zZbuKLwGuqXPV","filename":"everything is hate speech-.mp4","files":[{"disallowBuy":true,"duration":199.62195,"fname":"everything is hate speech-.mp4","type":"video"}],"genre":"Comedy"}},"payment":{},"extras":""},"signature":"IAgKfo37AZQRZq2BeVaOnXvVg0/upceCLvSyaH3X8gbfTtWH/HNDJ0kk5Bp/nimsHly6L+JoGvvNsY07zDNBc/k="},"txid":"5c693f5236b360cc422d5d12562cff3ec371dd7331f943eaeb8b48a907025370","block":2019714,"publisher-name":"RuckasNuckas"},{"media-data":{"alexandria-media":{"torrent":"Qmb1cByNF7a7eVssmhvYTkZknAQwCnXUbJJXkXwBVA5Z2D","publisher":"F7YyArmmDR6GnDEfQj8FgdVR9WauxSHoAR","timestamp":1483591490,"type":"video","info":{"title":"Chicago kidnapping broadcast on Facebook Live","description":"4 Chicago Teens In Custody After Broadcasting Kidnap Of Trump-Supporter Live On Social Media","year":2017,"extra-info":{"DHT Hash":"Qmb1cByNF7a7eVssmhvYTkZknAQwCnXUbJJXkXwBVA5Z2D","filename":"Chicago Gang Kidnap Hold Hostage White Man \u0026 Facebok Lives It!
